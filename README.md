# Lean-KG üå™Ô∏è

A Python library designed to generate and visualize dependency graphs of theorems formalized in Lean embedded in Euclidean N-space.

## About The Project üìà
We compile the collection of theorems in mathlib4, a massive collection of formal statements in Lean, together with their proofs. We then parse the proofs of each theorem for instances of other theorems to uncover dependencies, and store this data in a massive multiple directed graph G. We can then (i) extract subgraphs of G representing sublibraries in mathlib4 (e.g. GroupTheory, MeasureTheory, Topology, etc.), (ii) plot G as an interactive colored graph in 2D space using the Plotly library, and (iii) embed G in N-dimensional space using PyKEEN to analyze the hierarchical and relationality structure of library.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Requirements
* insert list of required libraries.

### Installation

You can install `lean-kg` using pip from TestPyPI:
```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ lean-kg
```
## Usage ü§ñ

Here is a basic sample implementation of the package, assuming all relevant libraries are imported:
```python
import lean_kg
!pip install -q pykeen[all] # Install pykeen
!git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git # Clone mathlib4

# Example: Build a dependency graph
G_full = lean_kg.build_dependency_graph("mathlib4/Mathlib", num_workers=4) # Builds full dependency graph
G_sample = lean_kg.expand_sample_graph(G_pruned, k=1000, max_nodes=1000) # Samples a random subgraph of 1000 nodes
G_group = extract_subgraph_by_subdir(G_full, "GroupTheory") # Extracts subgraph of statements from Group Theory

# Example: Plot interactive graph on the Euclidean plane
fig = lean_kg.plot_euclidean_graph(G, color_by="weighted_edges")
fig.show()

# Example: Train a knowledge graph embedding (set hyperparameters beforehand).
result = train_knowledge_graph_embedding(
     G,
     MODEL_NAME, # example: BoxE, RotateE, ConvE...
     EMB_DIM,
     EPOCHS,
     BATCH_SIZE,
     SEED,
     'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
 )
lean_kg.summarize_pykeen_metrics(result.metric_results.to_dict()) # Outputs performance metrics of the embedding (MR, MRR, Hits@k)
```
